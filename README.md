# MyUI - Contextual UI Generator

This is the project for MyUI - a contextual UI generation tool. This is part of the Software Engineering Project for BCS students 2021-22 at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

The documentation for MyUI can be found under the folder `Documents`.

## Automated Project Setup

Run the command `make setup` in the project directory. This will build and run the docker containers, install frontend dependencies, create the database connection in Hasura as well as apply all the migrations.

## Manual Steps to start a new project

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the project folder
3. Run `npm i` to install all node dependencies
4. Run `yarn` to install all yarn dependencies
5. Make sure you do not have already running docker containers in this directory and run `make build-dev` to create the development environment.
6. Open Hasura console: `make console`
7. Check Hasura console for an existing database schema. If there are none, create a database schema under the `Data` tab called `Hasura-test`.
8. Close Hasura console with `Ctrl + C` and run all database migrations: `make run-migrations`
9. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the React frontend in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `make build-dev`

This builds and runs the containers in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the React frontend in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.

The Postgres database runs on port 5432.

### `make build-prod`

Builds the React app for production to the `build` folder and hosts it on an NGINX server.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the React frontend (production mode) in the browser.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `make run-dev`

This runs the containers in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the React frontend in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.

The Postgres database runs on port 5432.

### `make run-prod`

This runs the React app for production and hosts it on an NGINX server.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the React frontend (production mode) in the browser.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `make restart`

This restarts the all containers in the currently running environment.

### `make console`

This runs the Hasura console.
Open [http://localhost:9695](http://localhost:9695) to view the Hasura-GraphQL console in the browser.\
For any change made to the database in the Hasura console, a migration is automatically generated in the directory `./hasura/migrations`

### `make squash-migrations name=<insert-name> from=<insert-first-migration-to-squash>`

This squashes all the migrations in the hasura folder starting from the migration mentioned in the `from` argument. The `from` argument receives the ID of the migration from which you want to start squashing till the last migration available. Please also give the squashed migration a name with the `name` argument first. Whether you want to delete the previous migrations or not is your own choice.\
Squashed migrations are generated in the directory `./hasura/migrations`

### `npm run lint`

This checks the code quality for the entire project and gives a detailed list of errors.
In order to disable linting for a particular line, the comment `// eslint-disable-next-line` can be used.

### `make test`

This will run all available tests.

## Common Errors

### `'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`

1. Download Make for Windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
2. Add the path (i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin) to your Path variable
